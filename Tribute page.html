                    he was exposed to a liberal education that defined the contours of his thought and his poetry during 
                    the entire period of his life. Beginning his educational career at the Scottish Mission School, 
                    he went on to acquire his M. A. in Philosophy, before joining Trinity College, and later earning the

                    he taught philosophy, practised law, got involved in politics, and also attended the second Round Table 
                    Conference. Even while he favoured the idea of the creation of Pakistan and is venerated there as the national 
                    poet, he wrote the famous patriotic song that celebrates the greatness of India.  King George V decorated him
